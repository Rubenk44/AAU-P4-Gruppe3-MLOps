# MLOps Course Project

This repository contains our group project for the MLOps course. The project aims to demonstrate a complete MLOps pipeline by integrating key concepts from the course with an actual implementation. Each module in the course is supported by proof of concept implementations, benchmark results, and documentation.

## Overview

Our project was designed to:
- **Implement an MLOps Pipeline:** Incorporate best practices in reproducible machine learning, version control, and experiment management.
- **Document Each Module:** Provide detailed documentation and justification for every step taken in the pipeline. This includes before/after benchmark results and screenshots (e.g., GPU utilization).
- **Integrate Source Code and Configurations:** Maintain all code and configuration files on GitHub for transparency and reproducibility.

For each course module, our documentation includes:
- A summary of what was implemented.
- Justification for the chosen approach.
- Evidence (results, screenshots, logs) to support our implementation.
